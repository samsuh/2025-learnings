# 2025-learnings

## Purpose
The purpose of this file is to track and measure the different topics and levels of learning accomplished over the year. Additionally it is a scratchpad and workspace for me to aggregate the different resources I found useful and that I want to revisit at a later date. 

Watching someone build a qc at home using lasers:

Thoughts: It was a very well made course to introduce the various concepts in QC. I realized that I need better fundamentals in Linear Algebra.

NextJS course on Udemy
https://www.udemy.com/course/next-js-the-complete-developers-guide/
Completed it last year, but going through it again with a better understanding of SQL and databases. The goal here is to get practice with the NextJS side but also to understand what exactly is happening on the datbase side. 
Thoughts: It's already going well, with more of the prisma ORM stuff making more sense. 
Progress: A few days in after helping host the bootcamp, I'm getting into the second project in the tutorial and it's making sense.
