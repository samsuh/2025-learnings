# 2025-learnings

## Purpose
The purpose of this file is to track and measure the different topics and levels of learning accomplished over the year. Additionally it is a scratchpad and workspace for me to aggregate the different resources I found useful and that I want to revisit at a later date. 

Watching someone build a qc at home using lasers:

Thoughts: illustrates basic qc application using light and a prism.

Thoughts: It was a very well made course to introduce the various concepts in QC. I realized that I need better fundamentals in Linear Algebra.

This one did not work for me. I found a different Linear Algenbra tutorial to follow.

NextJS course on Udemy
https://www.udemy.com/course/next-js-the-complete-developers-guide/
Completed it last year, but going through it again with a better understanding of SQL and databases. The goal here is to get practice with the NextJS side but also to understand what exactly is happening on the datbase side. 
Thoughts: It's already going well, with more of the prisma ORM stuff making more sense. 
Progress: A few days in after helping host the bootcamp, I'm getting into the second project in the tutorial and it's making sense. There are some changes since Next14 that require some refactoring/adjusting. implemented the routing and rendering to homepage of the list of snippets. i went through another iteration of spinning up the nextjs project. got through initial setup, prisma setup, create resource page, creating the resource on the db, getting and rendering a list of all resources, and showing individual resource on its own page. Next I have to focus on building out the Edit page and then delete - it's a client component because it wants to use the monaco editor which requires both state and hooks. client components should be separated out into the /components directory to make them both reusable and keep things organized. The edit page makes sense, but im having trouble thinking of it from scratch. the props comes into the function, create an interface for typescript to take in the params from the url and wrap it in a Promise because next15 changed that. once it's there, create a components folder at src/components and create the editor as a client component to use hooks/state. server components for data fetching, client components for working with it locally using state/hooks. I cant seem to get rid of a warning message about awaiting params.id, which should be taken care of, but it might be a bug in nextjs15. i'll leave it and proceed.
